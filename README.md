# High-Performance-Computing

This repository is dedicated to the author's course work on the DA-IICT course CS301: High Performance Computing. The project submission for the HPC course in this folder contains a much more detailed analysis.

Today, nearly all computing systems including mobile phones, laptops, desktops, supercomputers, and large-scale data centers are being built using multiple-cors processors. Unlike the past, today almost all increases in system performance come from increased parallelism rather than increase in clock frequency. This shift to multi-core chips affects all segments of the IT industry and all areas of Computer Science. To efficiently work with these multi-core processors the users should acquire parallel programming and High Performance Computing (HPC) skills. HPC is also a key driver in the field of data science. This course was an introduction to parallel computing and aims at teaching basic models of parallel programming including the principles of parallel algorithm design, parallel computer architectures, programming models for shared and distributed-memory systems, message passing programming models used for cluster computing along with some important algorithms for parallel systems.
